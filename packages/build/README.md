# Wren Security UI - Build

Shared build pipeline methods and BOM for the build process.

This package contains opinionated build transformations and configuration. Projects that
use this package don't have to define build-time dependencies and configure build tasks.

Using this package means that we have a unified build infrastructure and any related issue
(e.g. vulnerable build-time dependency) can be solved here.
